With New Hampshire result, Trump is a serious contender, and Kasich is back in the race

February 9 2016

With a commanding victory Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary, billionaire Donald Trump — the nightmare of the GOP establishment — has stamped himself as a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination.

The question now is which candidate, or two, will be strong enough to stop him.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who's been a speck in polls, finished second and achieved the breakout moment he was seeking in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.

But far from clarifying the GOP race, the results — with Kasich and others bunched far behind Trump — further unsettled a contest that was already wide open and exceedingly unpredictable.

Trump was exuberant in victory, exclaiming to a rollicking crowd of hundreds of supporters in Manchester, "Oh, wow! Wow. Wow. Wow. So beautiful. So beautiful."
"We are going to do something so good and so fast and so strong, and the world is going to respect us again," he said. "Believe me."

The crowd chanted over and over, "USA! USA! USA!" along with "Trump! Trump! Trump!"

But the mood among others in the Republican Party, especially many in Washington, was decidedly less celebratory. They point to Trump's many offensive remarks targeting women, minorities and the handicapped, among others, and fear that nominating him will amount to political suicide come November.
