                <p><em>'Kung Fu Panda 3' is, of course, the newest chapter in the Panda trilogy.</em> This one, much like the others, plays off of its predecessors. With 'Kung Fu Panda 3' the Dragon Warrior finally meets his father. His real father for that matter. This naturally throws off the mojo of everyone around him. Especially his goose step father....thing. Aside from this singular plot point this film is nearly identical in structure to its predecessors. Po is asked to accomplish a seemingly impossible task with in a paper thin time frame and as he is going about this he (for some reason) has a sort of identity crisis. And, just as the story needs him to, he over comes right on time. </p>

                <p> <em>If you think you've heard this plot line before, you have.</em> It's in every single Disney sports movie ever. It's the same formula used in the first two films as well. Yet, somehow, the first two are actually a whole lot of fun with a surprising amount of depth. The first two were bright, fun, and big but never sacrificed character or depth.</p>
                <p> <em>Unfortunately, 'Kung Fu Panda 3' does.</em> The biggest issue I had with this film outside of the recycled structure was the villain. Each prior film had a menacing but clearly motivated villain for Po to face. While this one doesn't lack menace, his motives and past are fairly unclear. </p>

                <p><em>Once the credits started rolling for Dirty Grandpa, the only thing I could say was, "Oh my god." It was shocking.</em> From beginning to end the movie is shock humor, gross-out humor, crass, offensive, childish and stupid. But you know what? I laughed a lot. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained throughout most of this movie. Sure, it follows a lot of road trip movie tropes and the perfunctory fight/make-up conflict near the end, but one thing about Dirty Grandpa is that it's consistent. Dirty joke after dirty joke; some of them hit, some of them miss, but they don't stop.</p>

                <p><em>What surprised me most about Dirty Grandpa is the chemistry between Zac Efron and Robert De Niro.</em> They have a great comedic rapport that actually feels authentic, which helps the more insane scenes retain some semblance of realism (as thin as it may be). 
                <p><em>Oddly enough, De Niro feels right at home here.</em> It's as if his character from Meet the Parents went off the deep end and decided to go on a spring break road trip with Zac Efron. Seriously, his character is ex-special forces and everything. Efron also proves once again that he's a comedic force to be reckoned with playing the straight corporate man put in awkward social situations.<p>

                <p><em>The special effects are stout, though not be as spectacular as The Perfect Storm (2010) or In the Heart of the Sea (2015),</em>and it's the human-factor that provides more than enough thrills, excitement, and tension. In fact, the biggest issue I had was that I saw a 3-D version which is an absolute disservice to the film. Most of the story takes place at night and at sea, so the 3-D consequence of dimmed light and muted colors results in a far too dark and dull look to the film.</p>
                <p><em>Disney makes feel-good movies. Their target market is not cynics or the overly critical among us.</em> The romance pushes the "corny" meter, but keeps with tradition of other Disney movies based on true stories like The Rookie (2002) and Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story (2005). Keep this in mind you'll likely find this one pretty entertaining. Stick around for the closing credits as a slew of real photographs from the actual 1952 event are displayed, as are photos of the real heroes from that night.</p>

                <p> <em>DiCaprio plays "Hugh Glass", an historical figure who was a legendary fur-trapper </em>in the early 1800's and the central figure in this bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the years, the 'facts' align with the film's basic story. Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass's party is striking across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear.<p>

                <p><em> Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson).</em> Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace. Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won't go into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous odds stacked against him.<em>
                <p><em>This is surely DiCaprio's year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a cripplingly painful performance.</em> It is clear that the suffering on screen is not all acting.</p>
